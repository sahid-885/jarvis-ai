J.A.R.V.I.S APPLICATION PACKAGE
===============================

This directory is the main Python package for the J.A.R.V.I.S backend.
The presence of __init__.py makes Python treat 'app' as a package, so you can:

  from app.main import app
  from app.models import ChatRequest
  from app.services.chat_service import ChatService

FILE STRUCTURE:
  app/
    __init__.py   - This file; marks 'app' as a package.
    main.py       - FastAPI app and all HTTP endpoints (/chat, /chat/realtime, /health, etc.).
    models.py     - Pydantic models for API requests, responses, and internal chat storage.
    services/     - Business logic: chat sessions, Groq LLM, realtime (Tavily + Groq), vector store.
    utils/        - Helpers: retry with backoff, current date/time for the LLM prompt.
